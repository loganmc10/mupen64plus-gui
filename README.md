# mupen64plus-gui

mupen64plus-gui is written in Qt5.
It supports everything you'd expect from a mupen64plus frontend
(plugin selection, configuration editing, save state management, screenshots, pausing, etc).

You can try this out by downloading [**m64p**](https://m64p.github.io/).
**m64p** is mupen64plus + GLideN64 + this GUI

Enjoy and happy hacking!

## Dependencies

- [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) 5.4
  (this comes statically linked with the Windows binary build in m64p, so you don't need to worry about this on Windows)
- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/)

## Building (tested on GNU/Linux and MinGW)

On Debian and Ubuntu, you'll want to install ```qt5-default```.

cd mupen64plus-gui
mkdir build
cd build
qmake ../mupen64plus-gui.pro
